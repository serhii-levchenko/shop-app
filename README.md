# Task description

We want to add the ability for our clients to buy our products from a mobile app.

As a user, I should see a list of products, and each product should have the following components: 
- Image
- Name
- Price

If I click on an item, an item detail’s screen should be open. 
If I click on the buy button, an item should be added to the cart, and the number of items in the cart should increase. 
If I click on the cart icon, the shop tab should be open with all items in the cart. 

The checkout page allows you to add or remove an item from the cart. 
Also, you can open an item’s detail page

## Note: 
Please lay down the architecture of the project bearing in mind that it should be scalable. Try to use structure and libraries closely to the real project you would start nowadays. Be ready to justify your decisions and solutions.
